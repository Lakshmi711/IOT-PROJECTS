- **IR_Sensor.ino** – Detects obstacles using an infrared sensor.
- **NPK_Sensor.ino** – Measures soil nutrient levels (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium).
- **SoilMoisture_Sensor.ino** – Monitors soil moisture for irrigation automation.
- **Ultrasonic_Sensor.ino** – Calculates distance using ultrasonic waves.
- **LDR_Sensor.ino** – Detects light intensity with an LDR.
- **Relay_Module.ino** – Controls appliances through a relay module.
- **ESP8266_WiFi.ino** – Connects an ESP8266 to a WiFi network.
- **ESP32_WiFi.ino** – Connects an ESP32 to a WiFi network.
- **LoRa_Communication.ino** – Sends and receives data over LoRa.
- **Servo_Motor.ino** – Moves a servo motor to a specific angle.
